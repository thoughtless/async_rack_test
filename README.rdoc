== DESCRIPTION:

Extends rack-test to make working with EventMachine easier.

== SYNOPSIS:

A quick example:

  require 'spec_helper'
  require 'async_rack_test'

  describe MyAsyncApp, :type => :request do
    include AsyncRackTest::Methods
    let(:app) { MyAsyncApp.new }

    it 'should be successful' do
      apost "/some_url", "some data"

      last_response.should be_ok
    end
  end


== REQUIREMENTS:

TODO


== INSTALL:

TODO


== RUNNING THE SPECS:

If you want to run the tests for this gem, note that the included .rspec file
excludes the slow tests by default. To run the slow tests, use something like:

  be rspec spec --tag slow


  # With docker
  docker-compose build
  docker-compose run test
  docker-compose run test bundle exec rspec spec --tag slow

== TODO:

MAYBE: look into rack-test giving us a simple hook to add middleware
* ultimately AsyncRackTest just inserts ResyncApp as middleware
* maybe I can just do something like "use ResyncApp" rather than using my weird wrapper with aliases
Update gemspec file to include all the dependencies (development, test, and otherwise)
